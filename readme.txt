SEO Content Control helps to identify and clean up various sorts of weak content, in order
to improve a site's quality and to rank better.

== Description ==

Even if you care about search engine optimization, your WordPress site will quite likely still have 
potentials for an even better optimization. One very interesting area is regarding the many archives
of WordPress, which are feared by some because of their potential to create internal duplicate
content. In the best case, if a search engine finds the same pieces of content on several pages of 
a site, many of these pages will be ignored. In the worst case the recent algorithmic updates of 
Google (aka 'Panda update') make the situation much worse: if a site contains many such weak pages
Google might decide to derank the complete site. Either case is undesirable. A very straightforward 
approach to deal with this is to make your WordPress archives as individual as possible. The basic 
steps to do this are shown in the article [Five WordPress tricks for individualized content](http://www.linkstrasse.de/en/individualize-wordpress "How to make improve the presentation of your content") .

SEO Content Control is the dashboard to help you with this kind of 'Panda' issues. It helps you to 
keep track, which of your posts have too little content, and shows, where an excerpt or a meta description 
is missing. You get it all at a glance in a neat summary with red, yellow and green colors.

SEO Content Control will be your tool to get rid of poor pieces of content. Your users will
find your blog more attractive, and the search engines as well. Just try it out!
